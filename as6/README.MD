# Issues:

Learning Angular just for this project is kind of a large task and i think one week is kind of ridiculous compared to the difficulity of the other assignements.

Next time perhaps give a "skeleton" for the project? As the default angular project is full of garbage. 

Had some issues with the port and ip of the API. Had to do some fancy proxying, see proxy.conf.json file. 


Project is located in as5 (yes i know wrong name :) )
