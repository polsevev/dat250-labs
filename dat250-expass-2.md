# dat250-lab1

I encountered a LOT of technical issues with this assignement. 

Here is a list:

- Wouldn't compile on linux, had to fix path of database.
- Had to open each java project individually (should have been specified)
    - Fixed by opening individually
- What database was being used should have been specified. It as named Simple-DB which is an AWS database type, so googling was difficult.
    - Fixed by asking in the Lab
- A lot of the fields were the wrong type in the project
    -Fixed by changing the types
- Derby-db did not function to open the database (no clue why)
    - Fixed by using intellij built in db viewer

Ended up solving all these, other than  that i encountered no techical issues. 

Code is placed in this repository in the "Assignement2" folder.

I inspected the database tables using Intellij after it was showed to me at the group session.
